# Setup a DAG in python

# Setup a dockerfile

# Build DAG docker image
We need to build a docker image based on our dockerfile. 
This image is what Airflow uses when the DAG is triggered.   

# Upload the DAG
With our DAG image built we now need to upload it to Airflow.  

# Kick off DAG
We can start training NLP models! 
We'll kick off the DAG using our GraphGrid SDK, but it is possible to trigger manually on the browser.
